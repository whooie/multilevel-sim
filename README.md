# Quantum multilevel dynamics simulations

Tools for simulating driven multilevel dynamics in atom-light systems using a
variety of numerical methods for solution of the Schr√∂dinger, Liouville, and
Lindblad equations.

Currently supported:
- Time-varying laser detuning and intensity
- Easy composition of multi-pulse sequences
- Spontaneous emission/decoherence
- Rydberg/$`\sigma_z`$-type interactions
- Motional effects in a magic trapping potential

Planned:
- Motional effects in a non-magic trapping potential
- Phase/frequency/intensity noise on incoming beams
